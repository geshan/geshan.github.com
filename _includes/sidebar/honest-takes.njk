    "quote": "Geshan has been Namshi's Swiss Army knife over the past 6 years: a great team player, solid contributor and adaptive learner. He joined the team and immediately embraced a new way of building software: service-oriented, with automated tests and built to last. His ability to adapt and embrace new challenges has been exceptional, and it was with a calm, receptive spirit that he tackled each and every challenge here at Namshi. Over the past few years, he established himself as one of our top contributors, able to directly discuss approaches and solutions with stakeholders: he operated with a lot of autonomy as one of our most senior engineers, and never encountered major setbacks. There have been multiple instances when, faced with an impending issue, I would rely on Geshan to take over and save the day. I also appreciated the fact that I could have an open, honest conversation with him regarding scope, timelines, and challenges -- there was never a day when I felt I couldn't trust him. Dedicated and devoted to helping his teammates, he definitely left a mark on a few of our other engineers through knowledge-sharing and teamwork. Would definitely recommend him to anyone looking for a solid software engineer with a knack for understanding the business side of the work.",
