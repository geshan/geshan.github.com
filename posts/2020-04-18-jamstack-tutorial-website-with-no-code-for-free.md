## Prerequisites

If JAMstack is something new for you have a look at my previous post detailing [what is JAMstack](https://geshan.com.np/blog/2020/04/static-vs-dynamic-websites-jam-stack/#jam-stack-with-a-cms) and some of its technical aspects. For this tutorial following are the prerequisites:

1. You must have a working email address (a no brainier, still good to be explicit).
1. Knowledge of markdown would be beneficial.
1. Knowledge of a static site generator like [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) would help.
1. Previous know-how of using any Content Management System (CMS) like Drupal or Wordpress would be great.

## Services involved

You will need to register for the 4 (or less) online services to get your JAMstack website up and running. The good news is all of them have a free plan so your website will have a recurring running cost of exactly $0, hurray!

1. **[Github](https://github.com)** - To host the code, probably you already have a Github account :)
1. **[Netlify](https://netlify.com)** - CDN to host the website, it will be fast as it will be static files mainly
1. **[Forestry](https://forestry.io)** - Git-based Content Management System (CMS) service to edit the JAMStack website content, your content changes will reflect on the website in a couple of minutes. Still fast for a JAMstack website.
1. **[Stackbit](https://stackbit.com)** - Service to manage above 3 and glue all of them together to bring your JAMstack website to life.

Let's dive in now.

## Steps

### 1. Register on Github

The first step is to register on Github, If you already have a Github account skip to [Step 2](#2.-register-on-netlify). Github is the service that will host your JAMstack website code. You can do a lot of things on Github and it is the de-facto service of open-source software and general code collaboration.

#### 1.1. Start to register

Go to [https://github.com/join](https://github.com/join) and fill the details like below and yes complete the puzzle to prove that you are a human :) :

<img class="center" loading="lazy" src="/images/jamstack-tutorial/01register-on-github.jpg" title="First step is to register on Github" alt="First step is to register on Github. Github registration details">

Then click "Create account"

#### 1.2. Complete setup

After that scroll to the next page and click "Complete Setup"

<img class="center" loading="lazy" src="/images/jamstack-tutorial/02complete-steup-github.jpg" title="Complete Github Set up" alt="Complete your Github Set up">

If you want to choose other options, it is up to you but nothing is mandatory.

#### 1.3. Verify email

One more step is to verify your email, you will get an email for Github about registration with a title like `[GitHub] Please verify your email address.` open that email and click "Verify email address" to verify your email.

I promise you this is the only time you will need to verify your email, all other accounts have Github sign up Yay!

<img class="center" loading="lazy" src="/images/jamstack-tutorial/03verify-email-github.jpg" title="Verify Github Email" alt="Verify your Github Email">

After your email is verified you will see the blue notification on top of the page as below:

<img class="center" loading="lazy" src="/images/jamstack-tutorial/04email-verified-github.jpg" title="Github Email verified" alt="Your Github email is verified">

#### 1.4. See your Github profile page

Just as a quick check, have a look at your Github profile.

Carry on to register on Netlify.

### 2. Register on Netlify

Netlify will host your JAMstack website on its own Content Delivery Network (CDN), they have a free plan. So let's get a Netlify account too.

#### 2.1. Registration page

Head on to the [Netlify registration page](https://app.netlify.com/signup) and click "Github":

Leave the tab as it is or close it, Let get a new tab to register on Forestry.io.

### 3. Register on Forestry

Forestry is a git-based online Content Management System (CMS) service that makes editing content on your JAMStack website a breeze. Head on to [Forestry Sign Up](https://app.forestry.io/signup) page.

#### 3.1. Forestry Sign Up Page

Here too just click the "Github" logo to carry on with the registration.

<img class="center" loading="lazy" src="/images/jamstack-tutorial/23stackbit-both-connected.jpg" title="Both Github and Forestry are connected with Stackbit now" alt="Both Github and Forestry are connected with Stackbit now">


#### 5.7. Wait for it to build and deploy

We are getting close the, your website should be building at this point like below:

<img class="center" loading="lazy" src="/images/jamstack-tutorial/24stackbit-deploying-fresh.jpg" title="Deploying the website" alt="Building and deploying the website">

After a couple of minutes, it should be deployed, it will show up as below:

<img class="center" loading="lazy" src="/images/jamstack-tutorial/25stackbit-deployed-fresh.jpg" title="Your website is deployed" alt="Website deployed on Netlify with Stackbit">


#### 5.8. Claim website on Netlify - Authorize

#### 5.9. Click view website

Hurray! Let's see your website live, click the "View Site" blue button, your site should open on a new tab and look like below:

<img class="center" loading="lazy" src="/images/jamstack-tutorial/28fresh-working.jpg" title="Yes! your website is working" alt="Yes! your JAMstack website is working">

### 6. Edit text on the website

Good news, your website is up on a URL like [https://jamstack-fresh-a9bfb.netlify.app/](https://jamstack-fresh-a9bfb.netlify.app/). Now you have to edit it to make it yours. Let's change the homepage text to say something different. For that click the "Edit in Forestry" blue button, you will be taken to the forestry dashboard.

#### 6.1. Edit your website on Forestry

Click on the "Home" link on the sidebar.

<img class="center" loading="lazy" src="/images/jamstack-tutorial/29forestry-dashboard.jpg" title="Click on Home to left sidebar to start editing home page contents" alt="Click on Home to left sidebar to start editing home page contents of your JAMStack website following this JAMstack tutorial">

#### 6.2. Go to Home, click hero section and edit text

Then click on "Hero Section"

<img class="center" loading="lazy" src="/images/jamstack-tutorial/30forestry-home-edit.jpg" title="Click on home then Hero section to edit it" alt="Click on home then Hero section to edit it">

#### 6.3. Edit the text of home hero section like below

Now edit the Title to something like "Welcome to JAMStack test" and the content to something like below.
After that click on the "Save" at the top right and then go to the tab with your website open, it should start deploying now.

<img class="center" loading="lazy" src="/images/jamstack-tutorial/31forestry-home-hero-edit.jpg" title="Edit the hero section of homepage" alt="Edit the hero section of homepage">

As you might have figured out by now, there will be some mapping to do. Generally, it is easy to find the element you need to edit to get your desired result.

#### 6.4. Website deploying

The website will say "Publishing Site" like below:

<img class="center" loading="lazy" src="/images/jamstack-tutorial/32site-deploying.jpg" title="Deploying the text changes to Netlify" alt="Deploying the text changes to Netlify">

#### 6.5. Site deployed

After like a minute it will say "Rebuild Successful" now its time to click "Refresh" or refresh the browser.

<img class="center" loading="lazy" src="/images/jamstack-tutorial/33site-deployed.jpg" title="Website deployed with the text changes" alt="Website deployed with the text changes">

#### 6.6. Changes Updated

After you refresh you should see your changes, yes it is that easy to edit content.

<img class="center" loading="lazy" src="/images/jamstack-tutorial/34site-content-changed.jpg" title="Website content updated to reflect the changes done" alt="Website content updated to reflect the changes done">

Please check out the "Media" menu on the sidebar below the "Site" title and play around upload images. Add the images to your content. It is pretty easy.

## Further steps

Here are some of the further steps you can take to enhance your new web presence:

1. Please read through the [Forestry Product Tour](https://forestry.io/docs/quickstart/tour/) to know other things like adding an image from the media library and doing other changes. You will need to fiddle around with Forestry. It would be great to check the Forestry documentation for [Managing Content](https://forestry.io/docs/editing/) and [Media Library](https://forestry.io/docs/editing/media-library/), it is easy.
1. You can get a free top-level domain like a .tk, .ml, .cf or .gq for free. So you can have **mywebsite.gq** free from [Freenom](https://www.freenom.com/). If you want a .com try another domain registrar like [NameCheap](https://www.namecheap.com/).
1. You can then configure [Custom Domain in netlify](https://docs.netlify.com/domains-https/custom-domains/) to get it working on the domain name you registered.
1. If you are serious about your website or blog try to optimize it better for SEO, for this you will need some coding and help from someone who knows Go lang and has worked with Hugo.
1. If you want to move out from medium to your JAMstack website you can try Stackbit [medium import](https://www.stackbit.com/medium/).

## Caveats

There are some caveats you should consider for this free website, they are as follows:

* Be mindful of the **build minutes**, Netlify [free plan](https://www.netlify.com/pricing/) has 300 build minutes per month. That means each time you hit save or add a new image from Forestry it will trigger a build and deploy on Netlify.

> Each build will take around a minute or more and this reduces your build time quota of 300 minutes every month. So, it is advisable to bulk your changes, mainly the text ones and be careful and use the "Save"  button sparingly.

* Even though setting up the website is just clicks, I think this website will be a good one for a proof of concept or staging. If you want a great production-ready performance-tuned website there will be some coding changes required.

## Conclusion

Now you have a fully functional website in under 15 mins, there was no coding involved and you didn't even have to take your credit card out.

> This is just scratching the surface, now you can show your running website to people but do remember to optimize it well before going live.
