After almost 2 years, I gave another talk to the students of Prime College. Last time it was "[Things I wished I knew while doing my tech bachelors](https://geshan.com.np/blog/2014/08/things-i-wished-i-knew-while-doing-my/)". This time it was **Career Paths for to be tech graduates**. I prepared the slides at 9 and was already presenting the talk at 11:15.

## Slides

<script async class="speakerdeck-embed" data-id="d2961b06460a443c8e13535d8add0260" data-ratio="1.77777777777778" src="//speakerdeck.com/assets/embed.js"></script>

## Participants

The students were from Bsc. CSIT and [BIM](https://edusanjal.com/course/bachelor-of-information-management-bim-tribhuvan-university/) of second and fourth semester. They were high on youth and not worried about their careers. As it was a short talk, I wanted the session to be interactive. I was trying to get more questions out of them. Some of them were shy to ask the questions so they came in later after the talk to have a chat with me.

## Questions

Questions centered towards roles and problems faced by tech companies in Nepal. I answered the queries with the things I knew and what I had experienced when I was working in Nepal. Few of them were enthusiastic about opening up their own company. I wish them the best of luck.

## Conclusion

Students get serious about an internship, job and career only towards their final semesters. I think they should start planning for their internship at the mid of their bachelor study. By the 3/4 stage, they should know which career path should I take.

> I hope the short talk and QnA session helped some of the participants to think about their career plans.
