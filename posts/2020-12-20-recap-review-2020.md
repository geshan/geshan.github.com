This is the second time I am writing a year in review, the first one was for a [recap of 2019](/blog/2019/12/2019-year-in-review/). The year 2020 has been chaotic, to say the least. With COVID 19 turning out to be a mild world war 3, everyone had a fair share of this disorder and new normal. In this post, I am going to discuss the professional and technical things I accomplished in 2020.

## Featured

This year I got interviewed only once. At least I have 1 interview to share. I was asked to appear for a couple of interviews/panel discussions for youtube channels but I didn’t do it due to some reasons.

### Interview Developers Nepal newsletter

When Bibek Shrestha (not the one from Kandara :) band) asked me to do an interview for the first Developers Nepal newsletter I said yes. I got his email about it in mid-Aug (it was winter here then) and my interview was published on Nov 2 (almost summer here).

> Also, big thanks to Aviskar and the team to condense the over ranting into something concise and readable.

The [interview](https://developersnepalnewsletter.substack.com/p/issue1-inspirational-developer-journey) I believe has set the tone right for the newsletter. The second interview of [Anita Sharma](https://developersnepalnewsletter.substack.com/p/issue2-a-published-author-and-technology) is also out recently.

## Blogging and writing

In terms of the number of posts, this year 2020 has been the highest.

> I have written 24 blog posts and with this recap, it will be 25.

The year started with a post on the “Difference between backend, frontend, full-stack, and super stack development” which turned out to be the most popular post of 2020.

<img class="center" loading="lazy" src="/images/recap-2020/03book.jpg" title="Most popular blog posts of 2020" alt="Most popular blog posts of 2020">

Let’s look at other posts published this year that have gathered a good amount of views and read:

### Most viewed blog posts

Below are the most viewed posts of 2020 for the blog posts published in 2020 :

1. [Difference between backend, frontend, full-stack and super stack development](/blog/2020/02/difference-between-backend-frontend/) - Feb 2020
1. [How to use Docker with Node.js a step-by-step tutorial](/blog/2020/11/nodejs-with-docker/) - Nov 2020
1. [5 benefits of pair programming you should know about](/blog/2020/06/pair-programming-benefits-for-your-team/) - Jun 2020
1. [Docker build example: how to go from slow to fast docker builds](/blog/2020/10/docker-build-example-faster-docker-build/) - Oct 2020
1. [Vegeta load testing a quick primer with GET examples](/blog/2020/09/vegeta-load-testing-primer-with-examples/) - Sep 2020

Looks like when I write about docker it gets popular :). I have been a bit cautious about cross-posting this year for a better SEO strategy. I have cross-posted to [tech Medium publications](/blog/2018/12/5-tech-medium-publications-software-engineers-should-strive-to-write-for/), Hackernoon, and dev.to. I have been deliberately slow to crosspost after September to gather some more SEO juice.

> I have been lucky enough to get my posts published on [Daily Js](https://medium.com/dailyjs/node-js-mysql-tutorial-a-step-by-step-getting-started-guide-with-express-js-rest-api-287858df4e8d) (108K followers) and [JavaScript in Plain English](https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/5-important-reasons-to-choose-node-js-for-your-microservices-5744ec55f4b2) (40K followers) publications on medium.

I have also published a couple of my posts on [Quick Code](https://medium.com/quick-code/working-as-a-software-engineer-on-internal-product-vs-a-customer-facing-one-in-e-commerce-companies-644d70e4438d) (12K followers) and my work’s tech blog.

### Moved blog to Eleventy from Octopress

In March 2020 I moved my blog from Octopress to Eleventy. Octopress 2.x I can say is in a coma if not dead. I evaluated other options Hugo was one of them but [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) was a clear winner. It is simple yet super powerful.

<img class="center" loading="lazy" src="/images/recap-2020/04eleventy.jpg" title="Moved blog to Eleventy  on Mar 2020" alt="Moved blog to Eleventy  on Mar 2020">

My previous blogging software was limiting me as it took a long time to compile the markdown to HTML (CSS + JS of course). Now with Eleventy, that process takes seconds not minutes.

> With this ease I have been much better and faster at blogging than before.

I did not change the theme, not even the colors. Eleventy is a lot faster to compile the markdown to HTML (CSS + JS). To make things [JAM Stack](/blog/2020/04/static-vs-dynamic-websites-jam-stack/#jam-stack-with-a-cms) I have added the most popular posts on the homepage. It comes from an API and the posts are pulled in on build time. I also use [Forestry](https://forestry.io/) to edit it on the fly now.

### Blog posts target - 14 posts, reached 24 :)

For this year I exceeded my target on the no. of blog posts. I hope I can do it in 2021 too. I had set a yearly goal for 2020 to write 14 blog posts and a recap. Basically at least a post a month. I ended up doing 24 blog posts and this recap, making the total 25. Here is the breakdown by month:

* Feb - 1
* Apr - 3
* Jun - 1
* Aug - 1
* Sep - 5
* Oct - 5
* Nov - 6
* Dec - 3

Till August I had only 6 posts but Sep to Dec I pushed the tempo really up. As of Aug, I might have just reached my target of 14 posts. In the last quarter, I really pushed hard to get more content out. That brings us to the next segway of posting out good content consistently.

### Alexa top 1 million websites

First time in my life, I saw my blog make it to the [top 1 million websites](https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/geshan.com.np) in the world as tracked by Alexa. It entered the top 1 million race around mid-Sep at 748K mark and climbed up to 520K. Then it tumbled down to the 735K range in Dec and stayed there. 

Probably it will go out of the top 1 million but this is already a great achievement considering: 

> There are around [400 million active websites](https://hostingtribunal.com/blog/how-many-websites/) out of the 2 billion or more registered domain names. Basically being on the top 1 million puts your website at the top 0.25% of websites in the world which is not bad at all.

And FYI my blog does not get a tonne of traffic + it runs for exactly $0 a month.

## Side project

Similar to 2019, this year as well I focused on only 1 side project. The side project is [AU Tech Jobs](https://autechjobs.com).

<img class="center" loading="lazy" src="/images/recap-2020/06autechjobs.jpg" title="AU Tech Jobs homepage" alt="AU Tech Jobs homepage">

### AU Tech Jobs

We soft-launched AU Tech Jobs on Aug 3 and till now almost 2 dozen people helped build it in one way or the other. The [AU Tech Jobs App](https://app.autechjobs.com) does not have a lot of users but we think it is benefiting users getting 1300+ jobs from 50+ companies in one place.

<img class="center" loading="lazy" src="/images/recap-2020/07autechjobs-app.jpg" title="AU Tech Jobs app homepage" alt="AU Tech Jobs app homepage">

Most people contributed code to this platform which includes me. Other people like Ansubha helped manage the social media side of things for this side project I tried to lead.

> I want to heartily thank each and everyone who helped build up this side project. Thanks again.

I would highly recommend do only one side project at a time and get it across the line. It is not a good idea to have 2 or 3 running at the same time. As none of them is in a production-ready state.

## Misc - everything else

Some points that I remember:

* I helped more people find full-time tech jobs this year too. I helped a couple guys find a better second full-time tech job. I hope they will thank me and not forget the boat after crossing the river ;).
* My [most popular tweet of 2020](https://twitter.com/geshan/status/1265426642547048448) garnered 40 retweets (including quotes) and almost 60 likes. A screenshot is below:

<img class="center" loading="lazy" src="/images/recap-2020/08tweet.jpg" title="My most popualr tweet of 2020" alt="My most popualr tweet of 2020">

* I took a [social media break](/blog/2020/11/how-to-take-social-media-break/) from Oct 2020 and it is still going on. I might carry it on for 2021 too.
* It is said that I won the “[CI/CD writer of the Year](https://noonies.tech/award/cicd-writer-of-the-year)” award at Noonies.tech run by Hackernoon. I was a runner up in the [serverless](https://noonies.tech/award/hacker-noon-contributor-of-the-year-serverless) category too. Congrats to [Sagar](https://gmrsagar.github.io/) for winning the serverless category. Also Milap for winning the [Computer Science](https://noonies.tech/award/hacker-noon-contributor-of-the-year-computer-science) category. Good to see Nepalis winning.
* I did not do any public speaking, even virtual ones. I didn’t even attend any virtual meetups. Public speaking for me is connecting to the audience best done in person. With this COVID situation is it not possible. I did a lightning talk on learning day at my workplace THE ICONIC about setting up a blog and how to SEO optimize posts. The first slide is below:

<img class="center" loading="lazy" src="/images/recap-2020/09blog-seo.jpg" title="Only talk of the year on Blog and SEO" alt="Only talk of the year on Blog and SEO">

* I was promoted to Lead Software Engineer circa Sep/Oct-2020.
* I started using slack a bit more outside of work. It is a great place to learn and network. Among others [Xplorers Slack](https://xplorers.slack.com/) group is Amazing. They also run the great [Knowledge Academy blog](https://knowledgeacademy.io/).

## Conclusion

This year had its ups and downs.

> One thing that it taught us all is probably being resilient in adverse times. 

I hope we all get to see a better 2021.
