Let rebuild #Nepal, do what you can. As a software professional from past 6 years I think this is how I can help, informing
fellow Nepali software engineers about the latest software engineering practices. Lets step up and help as you can.

Below is the Part 3 of the Software Engineering Practices in Nepal Infographics. This time the visual info covers
system admin/devOps department, deployment culture, Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CI), virtual environment,
communication tool, log and server monitoring and other interesting facts from the survey. 

Again special thanks to [Ashish Singh](http://bit.ly/ashish-singh-blog) for helping 
me clean up and compile the data in a better way and the pretty [Ansubha Manandhar](http://bit.ly/ansu-blog) helping 
us group and compile the data into percentages, thank you for that.

**Data for the infographics is taken from this [survey](http://bit.ly/nep-dev-survey) response, I kindly request you to fill it.**
