Most often than not, the success of any project (or start-up) is measured in terms of the money it has earned or its potential to earn money in the next few years. We rarely see the human aspect of the gain. In this post, I am going to discuss how a side project/mini startup -- [AU Tech Jobs](https://autechjobs.ml) helped at least 6 people land full-time tech jobs from casual non-tech roles and how it has changed their lives in more positive ways during this looming pandemic.

## How AU Tech Jobs started

Towards the end of [2019](https://twitter.com/geshan/status/1209020866035638272?lang=en), I become a [Google Developer Expert](https://developers.google.com/community/experts/directory/profile/profile-geshan-manandhar) (GDE) for Google Cloud Platform (GCP) which landed me $500 credit for GCP. I had a [side project](https://twitter.com/intent/follow?original_referer=https%3A%2F%2Fgeshan.com.np%2F&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&region=follow_link&screen_name=nepal_news_en&tw_p=followbutton) running since 2019 and a fraction of the credit was used for that side project. I had this idea to make a job aggregator, with a simple problem to solve.

> The job searcher doesn’t need to go to 50+ websites to look for jobs of their interest, it is aggregated at one place.

The person looking for a job could follow companies, keep a track of jobs applied and do similar tasks. Along the same lines, I had also built a list of companies that provide [work visa sponsorship](https://github.com/geshan/au-companies-providing-work-visa-sponsorship) in Australia.

<img class="center" loading="lazy" src="/images/life-changing-startup/02autechjobs-site.jpg" title="AU Tech Jobs - a life changing startup" alt="AU Tech Jobs - a life changing startup">

I had jotted down a gist on 2-Jan-2020 with a basic outline of how I wanted to get this Job aggregator to life from an idea in my head. After a couple of months and some of my own issues to tackle, in Apr-2020 after COVID had settled a bit in Sydney I came back to the project.

> I wanted to do some microservices and I had a bunch of scrapers running in my head already.

I put a couple of them in code and the scraper microservice to pull the jobs from 5 companies. By the end of Apr, I had the scraper pull in jobs on a schedule from 5 companies using ScarpingHub (now [Zyte](https://www.zyte.com/)) for free.

## Getting more hands in the game

Sooner than later I had realized that building this myself is not going to be great. Neither will it help others who are actually looking for a job. Then my search for contributors began. But what was the point, why would anyone contribute/write code for free to support an idea some random guy has.

> The value proposition was to become a part of it, learn from others and pave your way to a full-time tech job. Another advantage was the network of people working on AU Tech Jobs.

In a matter of months, I had gathered 8-10 amazing people (some I had known previously) who were pumping code to the idea. I had already taken some shape and at this point, it was already 2-3 [Node.js microservices](/blog/2020/11/nodejs-microservices/ "Node.js microservices") on [Google Cloud Run](/blog/2019/11/why-use-google-cloud-run-5-compelling-reasons/ "Google Cloud Run"). One of them was the frontend [app](https://app.autechjobs.ml/ "AU Tech Jobs App") built in React and Razzle for server-side rendering (we should have used Next.js :), surely next time). I was architecting the solution in the little time I could give to the project and this amazing bunch of people was moving the idea forward.

## That soft launch

On 3-Aug-2020 we did a soft launch and publicized AU Tech Jobs in some of the social media channels.

> The response was lukewarm but we were not after the numbers, we were after up-skilling ourselves.

People who didn’t have full-time tech jobs were after that prized possession and those who had one (not me) were after the next better role they could get using AU Tech Jobs as a bridge.

## Joiners and leavers

Like any other idea, start-up, or side project. We also had some joiners and some leavers. The best leavers were the ones who had already bagged a full-time tech job during a pandemic. On top of it, they were already battling a visa situation.

> As it is pretty clear here in Australia if you don’t have a permanent residency (PR) or Australian citizenship your chance of landing a job is automatically at least halved.

And then without money, the motivation to contribute to a project also dwindles with time.

## First success story

The first person who had contributed really well to AU Tech Jobs was here in Australia and at that time was employed in an Aged Care center was SB. He was sharpening his programming and frontend software engineering skills with React like a lion devouring his kill.

> Against all odds of visa, not having worked in tech before he bagged a full-time job in Brisbane.

In just 3-4 months he really stood out and gave his level best to not only get the tasks for AU Tech Jobs frontend done but also lead the team in his own right.

It was a happy and sad moment for the team. Happy because this was a life-changing moment for him where he says goodbye to odd hours, needing to be onsite during a pandemic, and a job he did not love. We were sad because he and BA were the dynamic duo taking the front end of AU Tech Jobs forward. Looking back I think we were happier than sad :).

## Other success stories followed

The goal for AU Tech Jobs was always clear, not sure if we would make money. But the people who don’t have a full-time tech job and have contributed well to the project will use it as a springboard to get that prized full-time tech job.

That is what AK did and he did it pretty damn well. He had finished his bachelor’s here in Sydney and was working as casual staff at woolies. He is a full-stack workhorse, take my word for that. I see my younger self in him. He is skilled, talented, and driven.

> If AU Tech Jobs had the money/funding he would be one of the first people we would hire full time.

He sharpened up his CV and got an offer for a junior software engineer in December, he started working from mid-Jan this year.

Another one is RG, he had been struggling to crack that coveted full-time tech jobs for a while. Working at a supermarket then and doing odd hours like 6 AM to 3 PM he really wanted to break that chain.

> With more than half a dozen job interviews under his belt and lots of meaningful contributions to AU Tech Job’s backend and frontend I knew it was just a matter of time for him to break that glass ceiling.

Not to my surprise, he got an offer in Jan-2021 and started working as a Jr. Frontend Software Engineer from mid-Feb this year.

Then we have AM, she re-found her love of writing with AU Tech Jobs in Sep-2020. Now she is freelancing as a writer and social media person. Consequently, we saw AC get a job in New Castle being in Melbourne. We also saw SM move from Melbourne to Sydney for a backend Node.js full-time tech role. There were many, which I have listed in the timeline below.

You can read some success stories on this [blog post](https://autechjobs.ml/blog/side-project-helps-to-land-tech-job-in-australia/) at AU Tech Jobs’ blog too. I can go on and on with the other 3-5 people who cracked the prized full-time tech job.

> They not only increased their income by 1.5x to 2x but also earned the flexibility to work from home during such a harsh pandemic time.

They also get to work in something they truly like, not something they do just to make ends meet.  I am happy for all of them.

## Not all rosy stories

Of course, not all people who contribute to AU Tech Jobs landed full-time tech jobs. A couple of them did land 3-4 interviews but it did not convert to a job offer. Some of them did not pay much heed to the suggestions provided :). Still, I wish success and good luck to all of them.

## Timeline

Below is a quick timeline of the people I have helped land full-time tech jobs in the past 3 years. These are mostly Nepalese tech students who did their bachelor’s or masters here in Australia. So effectively they have spent 25% (6 out of 24 years) of their life in computer-related studies. They have the skills to get lucrative tech jobs. Some of them also had some years of full-time work experience back in Nepal.  If I can help them with their CV or refer them to a company in my network I will surely do it.

You can view the interacive [timeline](https://time.graphics/line/480450) too.

I have not got any money to help all these people, but yes I have got a great sense of satisfaction and happiness when I hear someone landed a full-time tech job. I have referred them to lots of positions. I have filled out reference forms or taken calls for being a reference.

> If software engineers like us do this small step of helping someone junior with CV help, referral, being a reference, or mentoring a person to find a job it translates to a life-changing experience for them.

If you can please do it.

## Conclusion

I have worked as a software engineer for the past 15 years in 4 countries across 3 continents. I think I know some things about how to architect and build scalable and resilient software.

> If I can teach the software engineering best practices and trends to these young people and help them land a full-time tech job probably that is one of the best forms of giving back to the community.

It is surely life-changing for them and it could even possibly be better than contributing in other ways like code or content. Thanks for reading!
