Listening to podcasts is a good way to learn new things. Like the last [time](https://geshan.com.np/blog/2015/10/3-podcasts-every-software-engineer-slash-developer-should-subscribe-to/), I have found some more podcasts with amazing content and sound quality. In this post, I will list 3 awesome podcasts. All software engineers/developers should subscribe to them now.
