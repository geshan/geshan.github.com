## Gemini 2.0 Flash (Experimental) Multimodal Capabilities

Gemini 2.0 isn't just another LLM; it's a [powerful multimodal model](https://blog.google/technology/google-deepmind/google-gemini-ai-update-december-2024/#gemini-2-0) for the agentic era. This means it can process and understand different types of information, including text, images, audio, and even video. This opens up a world of possibilities for creating richer, more engaging content that captures attention and showcases your skills in a way that traditional text-based formats can't.

Unlike other models, Gemini 2.0 has native image output, multilingual native audio output, native tool use, and a multimodal live API. However, some of the features have not yet been released to everyone. If interested, you can also look at the API and SDK [docs](​​https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/gemini-v2). As per Google’s official announcement: 

> Flash 2.0 is twice as fast as 1.5 Pro while achieving stronger performance, includes new multimodal outputs, and comes with native tool use.

Some have mentioned it as [revolutionary](https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleGeminiAI/comments/1heltdm/gemini_20_flash_is_revolutionary/), [game changer](https://aifocussed.medium.com/how-googles-gemini-2-0-is-changing-the-ai-game-with-real-world-use-cases-50ddabd19d83), or even the next ChatGPT moment. Does it match all the hype and accolades? I will leave that decision up to you.

Imagine having a real-time conversation with an LLM while showing it a video, sharing audio from your mic, showing it a live video from your device’s camera, or even sharing your screen and asking questions about it. All this is possible with Gemini 2.0 Flash (currently experimental, [released](https://developers.googleblog.com/en/the-next-chapter-of-the-gemini-era-for-developers/) around a week ago) with the Stream Realtime feature. We will leverage this next to enhance your LinkedIn profile, CV, and GitHub profile.

## Using Gemini 2.0 Live Stream to Improve CV, LinkedIn, and GitHub Profile

Now that you understand Gemini 2.0's capabilities let's explore some practical examples of using its real-time streaming feature to enhance your online presence.

In a new browser window, open your LinkedIn profile in one tab, your CV in the next one (preferably a Google Doc), and your GitHub profile in the third one. Then, on the fourth tab, go to https://aistudio.google.com (Google AI Studio) and click on [Stream Realtime](https://aistudio.google.com/live), then paste the following prompt into `System Instructions` to get better responses to improve your LinkedIn profile, CV, and Github Profile:

```js
You are now a combined LinkedIn Profile optimization expert and 
a technical CV writing expert focusing on software engineering. 
Your role is to provide actionable, easy-to-follow, and high-quality 
advice to improve a LinkedIn profile, including but not limited 
to headlines, about sections, and things the person is sharing on 
LinkedIn, is all geared toward the person finding a full-time tech role 
in Australia. Your expertise spans optimizing LinkedIn profiles 
and resumes toward finding the first or second full-time software 
engineering role focused on recent graduates. 

As an expert technical resume writer, focus on the XYZ formula and 
what both technical recruiters and technical people like software 
engineers and software engineering managers will appreciate in 
the resume. Also, emphasize keeping things simple, straightforward, 
and to the point. You should also be able to review and suggest 
improvements for a GitHub profile.

Adhere to the following principles and structure when providing advice:

General Instructions:
User Context Sensitivity: Tailor recommendations to the person's 
specific needs, considering the target audience, mainly technical 
recruiters and software engineering managers, goals, and finding 
the first technical role focusing on making a great first impression.

Clarity: Ensure all advice is straightforward, free of unnecessary 
jargon, and includes step-by-step guidance where relevant.

Actionability: Provide actionable advice with a clear path to 
implementation, including prioritization and how to maximize outcomes.
```

After that, click the “Select video source” camera icon and share the browser with all four tabs. For this example, we are using Sajan’s profile. He is a front-end engineer looking for a full-time role in Sydney, Australia. 

### Demo Video

Then follow what is done in the below 17-minute video to elevate your LinkedIn profile, CV, and GitHub Profile to the next level:

Always remember that an LLM can hallucinate, so think critically before executing the suggestions given by Gemini 2.0 Flash or any other LLM, as they give out non-deterministic output.

You can see this demo as scratching the surface; you can ask other questions to the LLM in the context of enhancing your LinkedIn, CV, and GitHub profile. 

> In addition, you can use this powerful LLM with real-time capability to solve different types of problems, such as debugging the code on screen or even using it as an SEO and UX expert.

You can use Gemini to solve many problems, but choosing the right ones is up to you.

## Conclusion

Gemini 2.0's real-time streaming capabilities offer powerful tools for enhancing your online presence and showcasing your skills in a way that traditional text-based formats can't. Incorporating real-time content generation and feedback into your workflow allows you to create more engaging and informative content for your CV, LinkedIn, and GitHub profiles. So, unleash the power of Gemini 2.0 and transform your digital storefront into a showcase of your talent and expertise. Expand on it and use the powerful Gemini 2.0 model to get help to solve other problems. Bring it on!
