This is a gem of a podcast. Hosted by Paul and Edith it has the right mix of technical and non-technical content Paul is the co-founder of Circle CI and Edith is the co-founder of LaunchDarkly. Together they make a great pair They put forward their ideas about continuous delivery and software engineering topics. Sometimes they even bring in guests which is like a cherry on the cake.
