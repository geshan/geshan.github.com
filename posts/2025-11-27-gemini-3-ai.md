## Prerequisites

Before you generate the hair style changer app on Google AI Studio using the latest Gemini model, Gemini 3, you will need the following:

1. A Google Account to access Google AI Studio
1. Understanding of how prompting for LLMs like Gemini works would be helpful. Reading this [guide on prompt engineering](https://cloud.google.com/discover/what-is-prompt-engineering?hl=en) would help you get some critical pointers
1. Knowing how frontend apps are built with React.js would be beneficial, but not needed

Given that, we can get our hands dirty with some code generated by Gemini 3 on Google AI Studio's `Build` feature next.

## Steps to generate a hair style changer app

To build a virtual try new hair style app using Gemin 3 on Google AI Studio, you will first need to go to the Google AI Studio app:

### Navigate to Google AI Studio

You can go to the Google AI Studio app by visiting <https://aistudio.google.com/> on your favourite browser. I am using Chrome and signed into my Google account. You should see something like the below:

<img class="center" src="/images/google-ai-studio-build/02google-ai-studio-home.jpg" loading="lazy" title="Google AI Studio home page" alt="Google AI Studio home page">

### Go to Build

Then click on `Build` to build/generate your AI virtual hair style try on app. And you will land on the build page – `Start` section as follows:

<img class="center" src="/images/gemini-3-ai/02google-ai-studio.jpg" loading="lazy" title="Google AI Studio Build link" alt="Google AI Studio Build link">

To build your app, you will paste the prompt as shown in the next section.

### Paste the prompt on AI Studio

After that, you can paste the following prompt in the `Describe your idea` text box:

Prompt:

```
Create an app that lets users either upload their own photo or take a 
picture with the camera, then select a hairstyle. After that, a new 
image of the user will be generated with the chosen hairstyle. 
This app should work for both male and female users.

Please ensure there are at least 40 hairstyles, categorized into 
male, female, and creative styles. Figure out the photo is of a 
male or female and select the right category automatically.
Also, please provide the output that includes both the uploaded 
photo and the generated photo with the chosen hairstyle. The user 
should be able to upload an image up to 5 MB. You can show some 
hair grooming and styling tips while the chosen hairstyle 
photo is being generated.
```

Which will look like the below:

After that, click the `Build` button and it will start building the app.

> At the time of writing (Nov 2025) it selects the `Gemini 3 Pro preview` model by default which is the latest [version](https://blog.google/products/gemini/gemini-3/) of the Gemini model.

### Wait for the generation to finish

The generation of the Hair Style change app will take some time to complete. You can have a look at the `Code` section to see the code Gemini is generating (or vibing):

<img class="center" src="/images/gemini-3-ai/04gais-generting-code.jpg" loading="lazy" title="Hair style changer code being generated on Google AI Studio by Gemini 3 LLM" alt="Hair style changer code being generated on Google AI Studio by Gemini 3 LLM">

In my case, it took 123 seconds to generate the whole app and then I clicked the `Preview` button to see how the app works.

### Use the hair style changer app in preview mode

I had to click `Allow` for the app to use the camera but I uploaded AI generated photos to test the app which looked like:

<img class="center" src="/images/gemini-3-ai/05hair-style-changer-app-preview.jpg" loading="lazy" title="Hair style changer app preview on Google AI Studio" alt="Hair style changer app preview on Google AI Studio">

I made the app go `FullScreen` – the option is besides the `Code` button`.  After uploading the photo of a [male](https://postimg.cc/WdNLYD43) (AI Generated photo with [Google ImageFX](https://labs.google/fx/tools/image-fx) for free), this is what the app showed me:

<img class="center" src="/images/gemini-3-ai/06list-of-male-hair-styles.jpg" loading="lazy" title="Hair style changer app on Google AI Studio preview with list of male hair style after uploading a photo" alt="Hair style changer app on Google AI Studio preview with list of male hair style after uploading a photo">

Notice, that it auto selected `Male` as instructed in the prompt. You can select any style, I selected `Man Bun` and then it showed me the loading screen for some seconds:

<img class="center" src="/images/gemini-3-ai/07hair-care-tips.jpg" loading="lazy" title="Hair care tips showing on the loading screen as per the prompt to Gemini 3" alt="Hair care tips showing on the loading screen as per the prompt to Gemini 3">

Adhering to the prompt it showed the hair care tips.

> Gemini 3 is much better at doing what it is instructed to do than older version. It has a very good adherence to the provided prompt, as seen above.

Once the image generation was done this is what I saw on the screen:

<img class="center" src="/images/gemini-3-ai/08spiked-to-man-bun.jpg" loading="lazy" title="Hair style changer app on Google AI Studio preview with original and man bun hairstyle" alt="Hair style changer app on Google AI Studio preview with original and man bun hairstyle">

You can see the original image with a spiked hair style and the generated photo with the selected `Man bun` hair style. Wasn’t it fun to build and this test app :) . Next, you will try a female photo and see how the app works.

#### Try a female hairstyle upgrade

To try out a female subject, I have generaetd a photo using Google Image FX, To try a new photo, I click the `logo` of the app on the top left corner to `reset` the app. Then I uploaded [this](https://postimg.cc/YLjK2ZJS) image and it took me to the `Choose a Style` screen:

<img class="center" src="/images/gemini-3-ai/09list-of-female-hair-styles.jpg" loading="lazy" title="List of female hair styles on Google AI Studio preview as a female photo is uploaded" alt="List of female hair styles on Google AI Studio preview as a female photo is uploaded">

Again, adhering to the prompt it auto selected `Female` styles and you can select a style like `Pixie Cut`, then it will show the `Loading..` screen with the hair care tips again and when it is done it will show something like the below:

<img class="center" src="/images/gemini-3-ai/10hair-style-changer-working.jpg" loading="lazy" title="Hair style changer app generated with Gemini 3 on Google AI Studio working on a female photo" alt="Hair style changer app generated with Gemini 3 on Google AI Studio working on a female photo">

You can also try some creative hairstyles with funky colors. I tried `Rainbow Hair` and it was funny.

There you have it your own hair style changer app generated by AI and powered by AI too. You can deploy it on Google Cloud Run and share it with your friends too. You can read on how to do that in my [previous blog post](/blog/2025/11/google-ai-studio-build/#deploy-the-app-on-google-cloud-run).

### Add another feature

You can also add other feature like a side by side slider. Google AI Studio also recomemnds some other feature you can add to your app:

<img class="center" src="/images/gemini-3-ai/11gias-suggestions.jpg" loading="lazy" title="Google AI Studio suggesting other features for the hair style changer app" alt="Google AI Studio suggesting other features for the hair style changer app">

You can click the `Suggestions` and Gemini 3.0 will build it for you on Google AI Studio. Try it!

Thanks to Google: Google Cloud credits are provided for this project. It is part of the #AISprintH2 sprint.

## Conclusion

Using Gemini 3 on Google AI Studio's `Build` feature, you rapidly created a functional hair style changer app with a simple prompt in less than 3 minutes. The model successfully handled style categorization, uploads, and accurate image generation for both genders.

This showcases how multimodal LLMs like Gemini 3 accelerate app development, making complex image tasks straightforward. From prompt to tested application, a sophisticated AI tool was quickly realized.

Your deployment-ready app can now be enhanced with features like a side-by-side slider or new styles. Google AI Studio and Gemini 3 usher in the era of prompt-driven development, offering boundless creative potential. Keep Learning and reaching new goals with Google’s AI products!
