Just knowing git and all team members pushing code to the main branch (master) is not a good practice. To leverage the most out of git, it is a good idea to do feature branching and follow a branching model. GitFlow is one of the options for doing a feature branching model but it is not so straight forward, In this blog post with a video and presentation I would elaborate on how a team can use `simplified gitflow` and get the most out of using git.

## Video

{% youtube "nwM2U-38JP8" %}

I talk about git flow for the first 15-16 minutes then I start answering questions on git and gitflow. Then I explain about other things in git which can be helpful. I did this presentation at [YIPL](http://yipl.com.np) on 11-Mar-2015. I know its a late post its like a part 2 of [Do you git your code? Follow this simplified gitflow branching model to improve productivity](http://bit.ly/s-git-flow).

> Hope you learn something new about git and simplified gitflow from this video.
