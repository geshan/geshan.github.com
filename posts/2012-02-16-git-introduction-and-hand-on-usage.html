<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Git is a &nbsp;free &amp; open source, distributed version control system which can be used for projects of any size and complexity. I have been using git for more than past 2 and half years, you can even see my <a href="https://github.com/geshan" target="_blank">github</a> and I find git essential for most of the projects I have been involved in. If there are multiple developers (be it one developer and one front end developer) you should consider using git. It is a developer's best friend and even helps you go back to history and see how your code/website looked like may be 2 months back (provided you do regular commits).<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-x9VAF7zgiA4/TzjLk6ZZI3I/AAAAAAAANeU/GZoKHjM_0ak/s1600/git_on_windows.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-x9VAF7zgiA4/TzjLk6ZZI3I/AAAAAAAANeU/GZoKHjM_0ak/s400/git_on_windows.jpg" height="297" width="400" /></a></div><!--more--><br />Git was developed by Linus Travolds yes the guy who coded linux kernel. He says "I'm an egotistical bastard, and I name all my projects after myself. First Linux, now git." May be true but git is free and a great tool to have in your development tool set. Git is more for the command line person so its not very easy to get started with windows. Now using the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/" target="_blank">Msysgit </a>you can git yourself quite easily in windows, so the slides below may be the icebreaker you were looking for to start git in window. (I am using windows 7 - 64 bit)<br /><br /><br /><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="486" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" scrolling="no" src="//www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/21373451?rel=0" style="border-width: 1px; border: 1px solid #CCC; margin-bottom: 5px; max-width: 100%;" width="597"> </iframe><br /><br /></div><blockquote>I hope this helps you to get started with git on windows.</blockquote></div></div>
