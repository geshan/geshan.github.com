<a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_L4bRnZ5TPr8/RgP2Y9lXWWI/AAAAAAAAABA/pqsL9cSPrZk/s1600-h/platina_GM.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_L4bRnZ5TPr8/RgP2Y9lXWWI/AAAAAAAAABA/pqsL9cSPrZk/s320/platina_GM.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5045146916293663074" border="0" /></a>After an intensive research in the 100 CC segment I had to opt for Bajaj Platina. Why you’ll find it later. The great contenders included some models from TVS, Hero Honda, LML which may even fall in the 125 CC class but I had to choose a cool bike with great mileage. As the advertisement states it has killer looks and the style with 108 KMPL fuel efficiency. It states 108 KMPL but currently in the first month has given only 50-60 KMPL, it was stated by the company that it will give only upto 55 KMPL before the first servicing. I have rode 600 KMs in about a month, I really want to witness how it performs overtime.   <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="">            </span>The killer looks include premium alloy wheels, matt finished black silencer, sporty console, sleek chrome graphics, graphite tinted engine and transmission and chrome streaked side panels. With the new exhaus-TEC engine it is bound to perform well. The SNS suspension does give you a great riding pleasure. The handling and braking is very good in this brand new stage but it will be tested as the time passes. From almost all angles the bike resembles Wind 125 but has no self start like the Discover. It does make heads turn but if it had a self start it would have been a complete bike. I assume it’s built on the old caliber engine which has power for sure but does make the irritating gear shift sounds.</p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="">            </span>With a tank capacity of 13 liters I’m freed from going to the petrol pump almost every alternate day as I used to ride the <st1:street st="on"><st1:address st="on">Hero Honda Street</st1:address></st1:street> Smart with tank capacity of just 3.5 liters I suppose. It has a mild sound not like the bold sounds of the Hero Honda model’s but doesn’t lack the always needed pickup and speed. The first gear is very powerful, but again clutch balance is what I didn’t learn easily on this machine. </p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="">            </span>Small things to consider, the rubber pad on foot brake is a very good small addition that caught my attention. The ride control on/off does work, it can be used to shift from economy and power mode formidably. The leg guard is very primitive so it had to be upgraded. Again the gear shifting makes lots of noise, the chain cover also emits unneeded noise. The gear shifting lever is pushed inside, which leads to the plastic styling being scratched by the shoes when gears are changed. The kick is regular L shaped which is easy to kick rather that the C shaped kick we find in Discover, but it should not affect as discover has self start. The side lamps as of all the Bajaj models are over stretched, looks very good but is prone to breakage. Tyres have no such defect till date; the ride experience on the whole is a good one.<span style="">  </span>Reading above paragraph you might think I regret the decision of buying this baby, but not I’m a very good critic as people say. The price of one lakh two thousand Nepali currency (equate to Rs. 63750 IC, which you people can get in a lot cheaper now at Rs 34000 IC, its very expensive here in Kathmandu, Nepal because of all the taxes) is well set for this motorbike. I love the alloy wheels and the bike’s performance even in busy roads. The bike has good speed when it comes to riding in the open roads. I have traveled around 60 KMs in a single day but the bike showed no sighs of slowing down which I liked, I know it is also because it is new. <st1:place st="on">Battery</st1:place> is also performing standard though I have put this bike under the rain few times but it hasn’t given any trouble. The side lamps switch is hip to operate, the key cover in ignition and fuel tank is logical. The oil indictor under the engine is a feature that is unique to this model. The horn also sound ok, it is not too sharp and irritating like that of the Pulsar or Discover.</p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><o:p> </o:p></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="">            </span>Overall the bike has no such features like self start, disc brakes but for a bike priced right with 108 KMPL it is the best option you can get in the market. </p>  Geshan Manandhar<br />Around 725 Words</div>

Starting off in a desert and train scenario it ends up in… wait, what’s the fun if I tell you how it ends. Shot is various locations like Brazil, Nambia’s Desert, Mumbai, an old for in India etc this film has amazingly projected the two curvaceous beauties Aish and Bips in a glamorous manner.   </div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">            Coming to the guys <b>Hrithik is simply the best in this movie</b>. He is the style guru with no doubts, acts like a veteran and gives action sequences as it was a piece of cake. Abhishek has an amusing entry as per me and acts well but seems a little bossy at times as his character. Uday is similar to the last Dhoom but his character has <b>added the zing of comedy</b> in this intense but still in vogue movie. There are no such supporting actors who stand out as the film revolves mainly on the leading 5. Rimi Sen puts of a good show in her small role. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">            The good points about the film can be tagged as <b>the technical work</b>. The <b>camera has been handled by an experienced person</b> the <b>editor also has magic in his hands</b>. Some camera angles in the breath taking locations are out of this world. Equally the <b>actors have also provided a formidable act</b>. The <b>background music by Salim-Sulemaan is the icing on the cake;</b> do have to tell anything about the <b>music by Pritam its</b> <b>just pulsating</b>. The <b>screenplay is also up to the mark</b> while the ending could have been much better, I sense there is a space left for Dhoom3 as well. <b>Choreography  Viavhabi Merchant is also astounding</b>, Hrithik is a fabulous dancer but Aish dances great when she is alone in the video with Hrithik she loose her composure aplomb. My favourite scene is the one with Hrithik, Aish and the gun.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">            Now the things I consider not that good in the film. The special effects is the first thing I want to include this list. I say <b>special effect is like a drug, best when you know how much and when to use it</b>. I don’t complain that the special effects are bad but at some point it <b>seems very unrealistic and kind of unnecessary</b>. About the actors <b>Bipasha lacks the poise</b> in some shots and in “touch me” the song. <b>Aish is looking skinny</b> in most part of the film but looks portly at the end, portly because she looks a little fat than regular. <b>Uday Chopra over acts</b> at some stages and <b>Jr. Bachan should have been built</b> <b>regarding his physique</b> for a role like this but he is OK. The only cool guy in this gang is Hrithik, he is just impeccable. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">            Now writing about the clothes, style, the gadgets including bikes and cars. The chopper looks very real in film just joking. All the stars are shining brighter just due to the skillful stylist. Everyone has dream to get clothes on them. Here also <b>Hrithik</b> steals the show, I read that <b>he as 17 looks in the film</b>. I haven’t counted but his disguises are simply flawless and so in sync with the movie. Other actors also put up a good show regarding style and carrying it off. <b>Gadgets are cool </b>as in the previous version. To a level it seems you are overdoing with the gadgets but the bike race in the end is sure to thrill you. Oh did I let something out already. For more detail information run to a theater near you.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">            </div><div style="text-align: justify;"></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">            To sum up, this movie if better than Dhoom. In simple words a paisa wasool movie and a must watch in the theater. <b>Grab your friends and let the reel roll</b>. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><o:p> </o:p></div><div style="text-align: justify;"></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">Geshan Manandhar</div><div style="text-align: justify;"></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">Around 675 Words</div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">Can be found at <a href="http://www.mouthshut.com/review/Dhoom_2-114905-1.html">http://www.mouthshut.com/review/Dhoom_2-114905-1.html</a></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /><br /></div></div></div>

Ltd is a relatively long name for a flick but <b style="">the initial promos were humorous and expressive</b>. Vishal-Shekhar’s dynamic duo has given a variety of numbers in this album but they have <u>their creativity centered on dance tracks</u>. The cover design is relevant and revealing the back cover even gives the artists who have played instruments, programmed songs etc in the album which is <b style="">different as well as respectful</b> to the artists behind the curtain. The mix of blue, pink and brown for <b style="">Sea, Love and Sand</b> is impressive on the covers. The fun conveying snaps of the jodis with the signature bus in the cover and inlay covers of the CD is articulate. The <i style="">six jodis on the cover remind us of a recent film</i> but here the married percent is cent percent.  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><o:p> </o:p></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="">            </span>Album kicks off with the first aired song entitled <b style="">“Sajna Ji Wari Wari”</b> which is sung by <i style="">Sunidhi Chauhan</i> mainly and <i style="">Shekhar Ravjiani’s</i> name is also visible in the color. Capivating techno beats seamlessly blended with <u>conventional instrumentation</u> with formidable lyric makes this song <u>stick to your head and your mouth</u> from the word go. It’s a short song but has the punch to put you down in one listen. Subsequently, we get to enchant our ears with <b style="">“Jaane Hai Woh Kahan”</b> which portrays the vocal skills of the talented <i style="">Shreya Ghosal</i> and effervescent <i style="">Shaan</i>. The use of <u>synthetic percussion and regular instruments</u> has added the extra zing to the song which already has a commendable lyric by <b style="">Javed Akhtar</b>. Akhtar has inked the lyrics of all the songs in this album. Next on the list is <b style="">“Albela Albela”</b> which is executed by Mr. Breathless himself <i style="">Shankar Mahadevan</i> and <i style="">Vishal Dadlani</i> with elegance. The rap back vocal supports the song’s dance feel. The <u>lyric is amazing</u> and the song on the whole makes you want to <u>jump on the dance floor</u>. </p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><o:p> </o:p></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="">            </span>At track 4 the sweet music of guitar runs down the ear with the song <b style="">“Halke Halke”</b>. This emotion provoking lyric of this track is vocalized by <i style="">Neeraj Sridhar</i> from the Bombay Vikings fame. The singer has <u>uttered the words with grace</u>. The music is simple and very easy to the ears. <u>Melody grips your heart effortlessly</u> and the upbeat instrumentation is simply astounding. Consequently <i style="">Sunidhi Chauhan</i> and <i style="">Gayatri Iyer</i> have amazingly executed the song titled <b style="">“Pyaar Ki Ek Kahani”</b>. The salsa type music makes you <u>want to shake a leg</u>. The <u>earthy but powerful lyric goes in sync with the will to do tango</u> in the jive. After it we have <b style="">“Haath Dhore Niye Chalo”</b> which has a Bengali title I suppose. This is an <u>instrumental track</u> to be more precise produced by Funcinternational. This has all the <u>qualities of a techo/ house type music with the typical 4/4 beats</u>. The words in the beginning and some parts of the music make it ideal choice for a background piece and a good track to end the party in style. Last but not the least, we have <b style="">“Halke Halke Remix”</b> by <u>Neeraj Sridhar</u> again. This time the <u>tempo has been increased and significant amount of percussive beats</u> have been added. This is a dance floor friendly track for sure. <span style=""> </span><span style=""> </span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><o:p> </o:p></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">            </span>All in all, this is a good effort by Vishal-Shekhar which I sense goes comfortably in sync with the movie. There are just above half a dozen tracks with one remix and one instrumental but most of the tracks are dance numbers which is fun. <b style=""><u>Variety in similarity</u></b> is highlighted by the dynamic duo in this album. If <u>you have liked prior album by the music director duo then you can be missing something if you don’t have this album</u> till date.</p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><o:p> </o:p></p>  <p style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(51, 204, 0);" class="MsoNormal">Geshan Manandhar</p>  <p style="font-weight: bold;" class="MsoNormal">Around 625 Words</p>  Also posted on Mouthshut.com at <a href="http://www.mouthshut.com/review/Honeymoon_Travels_Pvt_Ltd-119776-1.html">http://www.mouthshut.com/review/Honeymoon_Travels_Pvt_Ltd-119776-1.html </a><br />From the name of System_Shadow but Written by Me.<br />For more see:<br /><a href="http://www.mouthshut.com/user/system_shadow/1.html">http://www.mouthshut.com/user/system_shadow/1.html</a></div>

This got published in ShowBIz Magazine, Nov 06 ISsue<br /><br /> OLPC, is it a distant dream?<br /><br />Imagine a day when Nepali school kids will ask their mothers to recharge the battery for their laptops. This seems to an over statement in current milieu but it may not be distant dream.<br /><br />One Laptop Per Child (OLPC) association is a U.S. based non-profit organization set up to oversee “The Children&#8217;s Machine” project and the construction of the 2B1 (laptop model) &#8220;$100 laptop&#8221; converts to around 7 thousand 5 hundred NC. Both the project and the organization were announced at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland in January 2005. The organization gained its most attention after Nicholas Negroponte (the founding chairman of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology&#8217;s Media Lab) and Kofi Annan unveiled a working prototype of the ‘CM1’ (another laptop model) in November 2005 at the World Summit on the Information Society in Tunis, Tunisia. The whole project is the brain child of Mr. Negroponte.<br /><br />            This novel plan to develop a 100 dollar laptop and distribution to millions of school children of developing countries has caught the interest of governments and attention of many computer industry heavyweights. Some heavyweights supporting this praiseworthy causer are Google, Red Hat, AMD, Brightstar Corporation, News Corporation and Nortel Networks. Each company has donated two million dollars. The MIT Media Lab is also involved in the project.<br /><br />So, what is OLPC then? OLPC is a program to enable all children, everywhere, to have the best education possible. Creating and distributing inexpensive laptops will allow students to become more active and creative, letting them take their learning beyond the walls of their schools and off the pages of textbooks. These $100 laptops will serve as libraries, music studios, art galleries and communications devices, using an open-source software platform that the students can customize and expand as their learning needs and programming skills grow. These machines will permit students to move beyond static, information-centric views of computing and learning by providing a vehicle for experimentation and collaboration. All in all it will teach students how to learn from a wider perspective.<br /><br />Although no contracts with governments have been signed, Mr. Negroponte says current plans call for producing five to ten million units beginning in late 2006 or early 2007, with tens of millions more a year later. As from the map in the official website (http://laptop.org) Nepal lies in yellow category that specifies those countries which are currently seeking government support. Therefore in the context of Nepal we can encourage this project as it will uplift the education status of the whole nation.<br /><br />The Nepali localization of the OLPC project is “Mero Sanu Sathi”. Mero Sanu Sathi is the name given to the laptop that may be distributed to the school children of Nepal. It is not a technical project but an educational project which is of the child not for the child. This is the best way to revitalize and revolutionize our education system that runs at the pace of a tortoise. It does not teach the child but make them learn learning. We haven’t seen any government interest in this topic till date but some NGO’s and INGOs are warming up for this worthy initiative. Interested organizations in Nepal for implementation of this project include FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) Nepal Communtiy, Nepal Engineering College (NEC), UNDP, United Mission to Nepal, Education Network Nepal, Bellanet Asia/SAP International,   Curriculum Development Center,   IT- Resource Nepal (For More see http://wiki.laptop.org/go/OLPC_Nepal) . But in these sorts of project government help and support is critical. The non government and private organization cannot make this kind of project reality. So I urge government and all concerned parties to support this noble cause.<br /><br />So may be in five to ten years the children going to school in Nepal may be saying “Mummy mero saanu sathi ko battery sakiyo, charge garidinu na hai.”<br /><br />Geshan Manandhar<br />About 650 Words</div>

He is the lead and rhythm guitarist, lyricist and composer from Faisalabad. Multifaceted Goher has also proven his vocal skills in songs like Dil Haarey and Panchhi. He sold his cycle to get a guitar when he was 21. Gohar first came up with the songs of Aadat back when he broke his leg in Faisalabad and was bed-ridden for 6 months. Unexplored by the media but he is the real man at the rear of all the success and popularity Jal has tasted.<br /><br />Last time you were not satisfied with the lyrics you jotted/wrote?<br />No such experience as the lyrics is discussed amongst us and if anything is not satisfactory or incompatible it is discarded or replaced by something convincing. I don’t really remember a situation to be unsatisfied of as I’m pretty convinced about writing the stuff.<br /><br />Last time you were really impressed by your own song?<br />I must say it’s Teri Yaad and title song from our album Aadat, there is another song from our new album Payal but I’ll disclose it only after the album releases.<br /><br />Last time you all really felt like home in a foreign land?<br />Difficult question…Ah… I think it has to be New Delhi, India because its close to culture of Pakistan and the girls there are similar to Pakistan. The people the whole environment is like that of Pakistan.<br /><br />Last time you were bored by a concert/performance you had to deliver?<br />Something that we had to perform was last time in Road Killa, India. We had to take a flight from Delhi to Calcutta which as two and half hours, the we were told that the place was at a 6 hours drive from Calcutta to Road Killa but it turned out to be a 13 hour drive. We were all tired and didn’t even get chance to change. I didn’t shave and was in my sandal and the ‘sardion wali’ cap, but we did perform.<br /><br />Last time you were bored by a concert/performance you had to witness?<br />Actually, I’m a crasher kind of a person. I like going to concerts and things. I used to go to concerts by Junoon, Strings, Fuzon, EP back in Pakistan. I was convinced by all of the bands performances. Above all I liked Mikal Hasan Band’s performance. I love the performances.<br /><br />Last time you argued over shade/goggles?<br />I’m a very good shopper. I know how to shop. Last time I bought a shade was in New Delhi, I paid IC Rs. 7000 for it and that’s worth it.<br /><br />Last time you debated over Pakistani music?<br />Just last night, I had a discussion with the organizers. We had a huge discussion over the music, what is the importance of music, what kind a content makes a song successful. We had a huge debate on Urdu, Pakistani bands like all the bands including Jal.<br /><br /><br />Last time you visited your own official website?<br />(Giggling)… A month back, we had made a few changes at that point of time and visited to check the updates are done right by the webmaster.<br /><br />Last time you composed/arranged a song not for Jal?<br />None, I’ll always compose for Jal. My every song will be for Jal.<br /><br />Last time you thought of changing profession?<br />Actually…I’m satisfied with what I’m doing. I think I don’t want to change it. The respect and fame we have got is something totally unexpected. I’m definitely happy with it and this is what I always wanted to do. There are some ups and downs but I’m pretty much Ok with it.<br /><br />Last time you thought of climbing Mt. Everest?<br />I’ve never been to Mt. Everest, How can I… But I really want to see Mt. Everest. Next time when we will come probably if February in Pokhara for the concert I’ll see it at least. This time due to lack of time it was not possible.<br /><br />Last time you bunked classes?<br />Ah…I’m doing my MBA, I’ve taken up my semester break which started in September. I always bunk classes as we have to do a lot of things including practice and concerts. I regret being a celebrity as all the professors know my face and my other friends can try proxy attendance and still get away with it, but I can’t.<br /><br />Last time you had a nightmare?<br />Nightmare… I’m really tensed about the happenings from the last one week. We came to Nepal and want to take good memories back to Pakistan but the circumstances are not that good. It is our first time in Nepal but the events haven’t turned out as planned.<br /><br />Last time you really felt like a rock star?<br />Well, for being a rock star you got to have the attitude. And I think… I don’t know people can tell that I am a rock star but I believe that I don’t have an attitude to behave like a rock star. I’m kind of introvert, but when I’m in a bad mood I become the rock star. So I try not to get in that mood.<br /><br /><br />Last time you three jammed for hours without knowing about it?<br />Lot of times, back in Pakistan we jammed for 2 o’ clock. When me, Farhan, Salman and Shazi we all forget to see our watches and try to sing and sing. It has happened many times, last time was before coming to Nepal we were in India. It happened one and half months back.<br /><br />Last time you liked being lectured at?<br />It was just last week when I went to Pakistan Embassy here in Nepal. He didn’t give a lecture but he guided me really well. I really liked that as there was someone who took care of us. He guided me like a father.<br />Last time you liked being in a class?<br />It was our class of Macro economics when the professor asked me to give a presentation. I did it very well and got the highest marks in the class, it was good.<br /><br />Last time you were home and had food cooked by your mom?<br />It was on 23rd November, when it was my younger sister’s birthday party. There was a family gathering and I enjoyed it very much.<br /><br />Last time you said this is the last time?<br />I just said that. ha.. I actually think a lot of about other persons. Persons who are really close to me I’m over-worried about them. Last time I had to think so deeply about a person but I cannot help it.<br /><br /><br />Last words for our readers.<br />Well read this interview. I would like to say thanks for the love and respect you have given. Thanks to all people who came to the concert, the turnout was huge. This is the first time, next time we will come we will have more concerts. I want to tell them to come to our concert. Enjoy and thank you.<br /><br />Interview taken on 27th December 2006.<br /><br /><br />Geshan Manandhar</div></div></div>
