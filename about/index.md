Hi, I am Geshan. I am a software engineer, with more than 17 years of software engineering experience. Currently, I am living in Sydney, Australia serving Simply Wall St as a senior software engineer.

I have a keen interest in software architecture, microservices, and cloud computing. I am a language-agnostic software engineer (backend-focused) who believes the value provided to the business is more important than the choice of language or framework.

> Fiddling with [Gen AI](/blog/categories/gen-ai/), LLMs, new models, and tools like [Ollama](/blog/categories/ollama/) is something I do on the side these days.

Playing with Gen AI tools and evaluating how it can be used in your day-to-day work is becoming a need of current times.

## Consciously evolving

I was born and lived the majority of my life in Kathmandu, Nepal. I have lived and worked in the Netherlands, U.A.E, and Australia. This multi-cultural experience has enriched my life in various aspects. It has also given me chances to work on software systems of varying scale that millions of customers have used, benefitted from, and can rely upon.

## Day to day

Day to day, I use mainly Javascript (Typescript/Node.js) and some PHP (every now and then) with MySQL/Postgres database to translate business requirements into reliable, [scalable](/blog/2020/12/software-scalability/), and [resilient software](/blog/2020/12/software-resilience/) systems.

## Why This blog?

I have been blogging since 2007, I blog about things I have learned, things I want to share, or just something I want to rant about :). The best feeling is when you are stuck on something you Google for a solution and you end up finding your own blog post written some years back. That feeling is priceless.

Another factor that motivates me to keep on publishing blog posts is the feedback you get from people. I have been told that the person was looking for something technical and found one of my blog posts. The person added, it helped to solve the issue or learn something new. This also gives me a sense of immense satisfaction.

## Public Speaking

I have given [talks](/blog/categories/talks/) at tech conferences in the Middle East, Europe, United States, and Australia in the past years on topics ranging from ChatOps, Continous delivery to Microservices and Serverless containers. You can see a neatly organized [table](https://github.com/geshan/public-speaking) as a GitHub repo. I have also spoken at various meetups too.

I have also ran workshops mainly on Gen AI since 2024. The two main workshops I have done include building a [E-commerce product description generator](https://gw.geshan.com.np/) and using Gen AI to [guess the geo location of a photo](https://geo.geshan.com.np/).

## Side Projects

I have some side projects. I tend do one side project a year and get it over the line:):

### Nepal News English - 2019

[Nepal News English](https://twitter.com/nepal_news_en) Twitter account is a news aggregator that aggregates News about Nepal from 15+ sources. It was re-built in 2019 with Node.js and MySQL. All the code is running on [Google Cloud Run](/blog/2019/11/why-use-google-cloud-run-5-compelling-reasons/) as serverless containers. Please follow Nepal_news_en if you want to get all the news about Nepal in the English language in one place. It currently has 14.4 K followers.

### AU Tech Jobs - 2020

[AU Tech Jobs](https://autechjobs.com/) is a tech job aggregator that collects jobs from 95+ companies. Currently, the [app](https://app.autechjobs.com/) has over 2700 jobs listed. Its USPs include:

- Job description summary for easy reading
- Tag job as non-technical by using external categorization service
- Saved jobs
- Applied jobs
- Shows if the company is known to sponsor work visa or not
- Faceted search (search by multiple departments or work type)

This side project has been a joint effort of more than two dozen people. I thank each and every one of them for their time and support. This project was seeded from [Australian companies providing work visa sponsorship](https://github.com/geshan/au-companies-providing-work-visa-sponsorship) GitHub repo I started in late 2018.

AU Tech Jobs is still running after five years. I have written a blog post about it [here](/blog/2021/06/life-changing-side-project/).

### Bloggers union - 2022

I helped some techies to start their own blog.  4-5 people did start writing their own blog but I don't suppose they continued writing. More on it [here](/blog/2022/12/recap-2022/#side-project---bloggers’-union).

### Speakers camp - 2023

I helped multiple people get into public speaking in 2023, I still help groom new speakers. The basic idea is to push, help, and motivate people to get into public speaking of any form, especially speaking at meetups which has a lower bar than speaking at conferences. I have helped them with both the content and the delivery of their talks. You can read some [success stories](/blog/2023/12/review-2023/#side-project---speakers-camp), a couple of them have become Google Developer Experts (GDEs) in their respective fields -- more to come on this.

### GDG in each capital city of Australia - 2024

This started in mid 2023, when GDG Darwin was started in May 2023. I have helped start or restart Google Developer Groups (GDGs) in each capital city of Australia. From Canberra to Perth, thanks to all the volunteers and Matt for his support. You can read more on the [community aspect](/blog/2024/12/recap-2024/#community-activities).

There might be something in 2025 too :).

There have been multiple instances when, faced with an impending issue, I would rely on Geshan to take over and save the day. I also appreciated the fact that I could have an open, honest conversation with him regarding scope, timelines, and challenges -- there was never a day when I felt I couldn't trust him.
