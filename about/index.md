Hi, I am Geshan. I am a software engineer with more than 17 years of software engineering experience. I live in Sydney, Australia, serving Simply Wall St as a senior software engineer.

I am keenly interested in software architecture, microservices, and cloud computing. I am a language-agnostic software engineer (backend-focused) who believes the value provided to the business is more important than the choice of language or framework.

> Fiddling with [Gen AI](/blog/categories/gen-ai/), LLMs, new models, and tools like [Ollama](/blog/categories/ollama/) is something I do on the side these days.

Playing with Gen AI tools and evaluating how they can be used in your day-to-day work is becoming a necessity.

## Consciously evolving

I was born in Kathmandu, Nepal, and have lived there for more than 24 years. I have also lived and worked in the Netherlands, the U.A.E., and Australia. This multi-cultural experience has enriched my life in various aspects. It has also allowed me to work on software systems of varying scale that millions of customers have used, benefited from, and can rely upon.

## Day to day

Day to day, I use mainly Javascript (Typescript/Node.js) and some PHP (every now and then) with MySQL/Postgres database to translate business requirements into reliable, [scalable](/blog/2020/12/software-scalability/), and [resilient software](/blog/2020/12/software-resilience/) systems.

## Why This blog?

I have been blogging since 2007, I blog about things I have learned, things I want to share, or just something I want to rant about :). The best feeling is when you are stuck on something you Google for a solution and you end up finding your own blog post written some years back. That feeling is priceless.

Another factor that motivates me to keep on publishing blog posts is the feedback I get from people. I have been told that the person was looking for something technical and found one of my blog posts. The person added that it helped to solve the issue or learn something new. This also gives me a sense of immense satisfaction.

## Public Speaking

I have given [talks](/blog/categories/talks/) at tech conferences in the Middle East, Europe, United States, and Australia in the past years on topics ranging from ChatOps, Continous delivery to Microservices and Serverless containers. You can see a neatly organized [table](https://github.com/geshan/public-speaking) as a GitHub repo. I have also spoken at various meetups too.
