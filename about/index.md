Hi, I am Geshan. I am a software engineer, with more than a decade of software engineering experience. Currently, I am living in Sydney, Australia serving THE ICONIC as a lead software engineer.

</div>

I have a keen interest in REST architecture, microservices, and cloud computing. I am a language-agnostic software engineer who believes the value provided to the business is more important than the choice of language or framework.

## Consciously evolving

I was born and lived the majority of my life in Kathmandu, Nepal. I have lived and worked in the Netherlands, U.A.E, and Australia. This multi-cultural experience has enriched my life in various aspects. It has also given me chances to work on software systems of varying scale that millions of customers have used, benefitted from, and can rely upon.

## Day to day

Day to day, I use mainly Javascript (Typescript/Node.js) and PHP with MySQL/Postgres database to translate business requirements into reliable, [scalable](/blog/2020/12/software-scalability/), and [resilient software](/blog/2020/12/software-resilience/) systems.

## Why This blog?

I have been blogging since 2007, I blog about things I have learned, things I want to share, or just something I want to rant about :). The best feeling is when you are stuck on something you Google for a solution and you end up finding your own blog post written some years back. That feeling is priceless.

Another factor that motivates me to keep on publishing blog posts is the feedback you get from people. I have been told that the person was looking for something technical and found one of my blog posts. The person added, it helped to solve the issue or learn something new. This also gives me a sense of immense satisfaction.

## Public Speaking

I have given [talks](/blog/categories/talks/) at tech conferences in the Middle East, Europe, United States, and Australia in the past years on topics ranging from ChatOps, Continous delivery to Microservices and Serverless containers. You can see a neatly organized [table](https://github.com/geshan/public-speaking) as a GitHub repo. I have also spoken at various meetups too.

## Side Projects

I have a couple of side projects. I only do one side project a year to get it over the line:):

### Nepal News English - 2019

[Nepal News English](https://twitter.com/nepal_news_en) Twitter account is a news aggregator that aggregates News about Nepal from 15+ sources. It was re-built in 2019 with Node.js and MySQL. All the code is running on [Google Cloud Run](/blog/2019/11/why-use-google-cloud-run-5-compelling-reasons/) as serverless containers. Please follow Nepal_news_en if you want to get all the news about Nepal in the English language in one place. It currently has 12.6 K followers.

### AU Tech Jobs - 2020

[AU Tech Jobs](https://autechjobs.ml/) is a tech job aggregator that collects jobs from 50+ companies. Currently, the [app](https://app.autechjobs.ml/) has over 1100 jobs listed. Its USPs include:

- Job description summary for easy reading
- Tag job as non-technical by using external categorization service
- Saved jobs
- Applied jobs
- Shows if the company is known to sponsor work visa or not
- Faceted search (search by multiple departments or work type)

This side project has been a joint effort of more than two dozen people. I thank each and every one of them for their time and support. This project was seeded from [Australian companies providing work visa sponsorship](https://github.com/geshan/au-companies-providing-work-visa-sponsorship) GitHub repo I started in 2018.

## Feedback from colleagues

I have always strived to have a positive impact on the places I have work and the people I work with. Some feedback I have received include:

>
> I was particularly impressed by Geshan's ability to handle even the toughest complex issues in our squad. That skill often takes years to develop, but it seemed to come perfectly naturally to him.

<h2 class='text-2xl mt-5 font-bold text-darkpurple'>Alessandro (Alex) Nadalin, CTO @ Namshi - 2018</h2>

> Geshan has been Namshi's Swiss Army knife over the past 6 years: a great team player, solid contributor and adaptive learner.
>

His ability to adapt and embrace new challenges has been exceptional, and it was with a calm, receptive spirit that he tackled each and every challenge here at Namshi.
>
> Over the past few years, he established himself as one of our top contributors, able to directly discuss approaches and solutions with stakeholders: he operated with a lot of autonomy as one of our most senior engineers, and never encountered major setbacks. There have been multiple instances when, faced with an impending issue, I would rely on Geshan to take over and save the day. I also appreciated the fact that I could have an open, honest conversation with him regarding scope, timelines, and challenges -- there was never a day when I felt I couldn't trust him.
>
> Dedicated and devoted to helping his teammates, he definitely left a mark on a few of our other engineers through knowledge-sharing and teamwork.

He joined Namshi a year before me and his knowledge about the domain and his great communication skills helped me a lot to get up to speed with the environment. Other than being a good developer, Geshan has been a key role when drafting specifications or testing all the scenarios for a critical feature: he is a very precise and hard worker.
>
> I have always admired the fact that he stays very up to date with what goes around in the Tech world and constantly he tries to “give back” as much as possible to the community by speaking at conferences and organizing tech events in his home country. I really hope our paths will cross again in the future
