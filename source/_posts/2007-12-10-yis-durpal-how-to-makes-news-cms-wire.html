<div class='post'>
<div style="text-align: justify;">After web-publishing the drupal how to at Drupal Nepal, FOSS Nepal and around a dozen Drupal related sites I had no idea that it'll be reviewed like below by CMSwire.com that provides news, reviews and resources on Content Management System (CMS). It has been downloaded 300 times in two weeks time and if you want to learn Drupal then this may be the best thing to download at under 6 MB but above 90 Pages.<br /><br />The reviews by : John Conroy at<br /><br /><a href="http://www.cmswire.com/cms/web-cms/nepalese-drupal-beginners-guide-50-tricks-not-to-miss-002018.php">http://www.cmswire.com/cms/web-cms/nepalese-drupal-beginners-guide-50-tricks-not-to-miss-002018.php</a><br /><br />It goes like this:<br /><br /></div><p style="text-align: justify;">No<a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.cmswire.com/cms/web-cms/nepalese-drupal-beginners-guide-50-tricks-not-to-miss-002018.php"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_L4bRnZ5TPr8/R1zR7RmWj3I/AAAAAAAAALA/7cp4-U80by0/s320/CMSWireLogo_v2-02.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5142215690817015666" border="0" /></a>w there’s a headline you never thought you’d see. Young Innovations, a <a href="http://www.cmswire.com/news/topic/drupal">Drupal</a> development firm from the mystical land of Nepal, has released a beginners guide, in English, for the Drupal open source web content management system. <strong>Drupal how to For Beginners</strong> was developed by Young Innovations in conjunction with <span class="caps"><span class="caps">SAP, </span></span>and is freely available under a Creative Commons license.</p><div style="text-align: justify;">        <a name="more"></a>       </div><p style="text-align: justify;">Running to 94 pages and with screenshots-aplenty, the guide is comprehensive. The scope is similarly broad - beginning with an explanation of what a <a href="http://www.cmswire.com/cms/web-cms/"><span class="caps">CMS</span></a> is (as if anybody knows anymore…), and continues through installation, management, customization, and adding modules.</p><div style="text-align: justify;">  </div><p style="text-align: justify;">One small gripe — the sages behind this tome are rather more at home wrestling with <a href="http://www.cmswire.com/news/topic/lamp"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">LAMP</span></span></a> configs and pimping add-on modules than with the deployment of English grammar.<br /></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Witness this affront to Wordsworth and Byron:</p><div style="text-align: justify;">  <blockquote> “The primary target audience of this how-to or manual are people with some knowledge of web programming language and database more specifically people who know <span class="caps">PHP </span>and MySQL will be benefited to know and use such a world class product that also for free.”<br /></blockquote>  </div><p style="text-align: justify;">Tut tut. Let me get my red pen.</p><div style="text-align: justify;">  </div><p style="text-align: justify;">But to be fair, we’re not marking these guys on syntax and grammar. You just want to know whether this “how-to” is worth downloading as an aid to getting your Drupal website up and running.</p><div style="text-align: justify;">  </div><p style="text-align: justify;">The answer is yes, and in fact it’s quite a bit more. Young Innovations should have called this ‘Goldilocks Teaches Drupal’, because everything is just about right.</p><div style="text-align: justify;">  </div><p style="text-align: justify;">Right length, right level of complexity, right amount of ‘dumbing down’ for less technical folk — within their stated audience of semi-HTML proficient persons, right balance between explanation and overt instruction.</p><div style="text-align: justify;">  </div><p style="text-align: justify;">Despite the aforementioned length, most of the bulk is taken up with screenshots and you can skim it in half an hour and still learn plenty. The primary function it performs, even more important to my mind than being an installation/beginners guide, is that it gives an excellent overview of exactly what Drupal is all about.</p><div style="text-align: justify;">  </div><p style="text-align: justify;">And that, I’m sure you’ll agree, is a worthwhile result.</p><div style="text-align: justify;">  </div><p style="text-align: justify;">Download the guide as a <span class="caps">PDF </span><a href="http://www.mediafire.com/?fvt2jxsdxvs" target="_blank" class="external">here</a>, and if you want to have a look at Young Innovations’ playground, visit them <a href="http://www.yipl.com.np/" class="external">here</a>. While you’re at it, why not go here to have a look at <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/drupalnepal" class="external">Nepal’s burgeoning Drupal community</a>. Call it a cultural exchange.</p><div style="text-align: justify;">  </div><p style="text-align: justify;">In related news, influential Drupal consulting firm, Lullabot, has released a podcast citing “<a href="http://www.lullabot.com/audiocast/podcast-50-drupal-tips-and-tricks" class="external">50 Drupal Tips and Tricks</a>”. It’s already garnered 400 Diggs in just a couple of weeks, so tips like “Turn any <span class="caps">CCK </span>type with an imagefield into a photocast with ConTemplate” are evidently not the gibberish it appears to this non-Drupalist.</p><div style="text-align: justify;">  </div><p style="text-align: justify;">The cult of Lullabot has now racked up 50 such podcasts, and you can of course check them all out at <a href="http://www.lullabot.com/" class="external">lullabot.com</a>.</p><div style="text-align: justify;">  </div><p style="text-align: justify;">In related Drupal news, the latest (beta) version has just hit the street.
