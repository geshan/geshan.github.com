## [To Be Continuous by Heavybit](http://www.heavybit.com/library/podcasts/to-be-continuous/)

This is a gem of a podcast. Hosted by Paul and Edith it has the right mix of technical and non-technical content.
Paul is the co-founder of Circle CI and Edith is the co-founder of LaunchDarkly. Together they make a great pair.
They put forward their ideas about continuous delivery and software engineering topics.
Sometimes they even bring in guests which is like a cherry on the cake. The last episode #28 on [Goal setting](http://www.heavybit.com/library/podcasts/to-be-continuous/ep-28-goal-setting/) was amazing.

Another admirable podcast is Mixergy hosted by [Andrew Warner](http://www.andrewwarner.com/).

Andrew sometimes elicits such insightful information out of his guest. It is intriguing how he does it.
If you ever want to learn how to interview people this is one podcast you can't afford do miss.
He generally interviews tech entrepreneurs. The interviews usually last like an hour.
You even as a software engineer get to know important things about how to run a business.
