Podcast simply seem like a person blabbering about one thing or the other, of just gets some of his friends and tries to make you understand thing you never want to understand. Complementing to it the host again invites one or more experts on the topic and interviews in a funny, lets say annoying manner.<br /><br />Ok, that's too bad a definition I tried to portray in the above paragraph, Podcast is a series of audio or video digital media files which is distributed over the Internet by syndicated download, through Web feeds, to portable media players and personal computers. Though the same content may also be made available by direct download or streaming, a podcast is distinguished from most other digital media formats by its ability to be syndicated, subscribed to, and downloaded automatically when new content is added. - If you read it at Wikipedia <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast" target="_blank">here</a>.<br /><br />Now getting back to the topic there are some cool podcasts that you should listen to go get the news about Drupal how to user this module or upgrade that theme or even know about up coming Drupal event be it conference or training or other things. Below is the list of 3 podcasts you can enjoy:<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_L4bRnZ5TPr8/SY-BzqQV1nI/AAAAAAAAA88/q9vyd-2jYG8/s1600-h/main_drupal_podcasts.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 400px; height: 400px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_L4bRnZ5TPr8/SY-BzqQV1nI/AAAAAAAAA88/q9vyd-2jYG8/s400/main_drupal_podcasts.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5300598010954503794" border="0" /></a><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">1.
