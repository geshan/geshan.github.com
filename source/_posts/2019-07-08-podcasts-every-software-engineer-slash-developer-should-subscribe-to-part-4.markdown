Podcasts are a great way to learn new things even for the lazy reader. If you are not fast at reading or don't like it very much podcasts can be your way to get the information with less effort. It is easier than reading. This is a part 4 in the series (do check part [1](http://geshan.com.np/blog/2015/10/3-podcasts-every-software-engineer-slash-developer-should-subscribe-to/) and
[2](http://geshan.com.np/blog/2016/05/3-podcasts-every-software-engineer-slash-developer-should-subscribe-to-part-2/) and [3](https://geshan.com.np/blog/2017/01/3-podcasts-every-software-engineer-slash-developer-should-subscribe-to-part-3/)) of podcasts you must subscribe to and listen to as a software engineer. Same as the last 3 times the 3 podcasts listed below have great content and considerably good sound quality too. Below is the list:

## [Developer Tea by Jonathan](https://spec.fm/podcasts/developer-tea)

Developer Tea is an exceptional podcast to listen to. Jonathan sometimes does interview and most of the times it is a discoure on a software engineering related topics. A recect episode on [Mid-Year Resoulutions](https://spec.fm/podcasts/developer-tea/302953) was a strong reminder that half of the year is gone and in less than six months we will reach 2020.

## [Agile Thoughts by Agile Noir](http://agilenoir.biz/agilethoughts/)

Simply put Agile thought is an unconventional podcast. Don't be scared by the unusual looking cover of the podcast, the content is good. Mostly converational with some characters, the episodes are short and address day to day issues. I remember episoide 29 [The value TDD gives to leadership](https://agilenoir.biz/podcast/029-the-value-tdd-gives-to-leadership/) being an intriguing one.

## [Inside Intercom](https://www.intercom.com/blog/podcasts/)

Inside intercom is a superb podcast focusing on the product side of things rather than just the technical aspects. The most recent episode on [why product teams should focus on outcomes over output](https://www.intercom.com/blog/podcasts/josh-seiden-on-why-product-teams-should-focus-on-outcome-vs-output/) was an eye opener.
